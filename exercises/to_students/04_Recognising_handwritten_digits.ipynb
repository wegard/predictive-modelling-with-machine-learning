    "### The digits dataset\n",
    "We will use the [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) `digits` dataset (`from sklearn.datasets import load_digits`).\n",
    "This dataset consists of 8×8 images of handwritten digits (0–9). There are 1797 total samples, each belonging to one of 10 classes (digits 0–9). Each image can be thought of as 64 features (the pixel intensities) when flattened.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to build classification models that can accurately predict which digit an image represents.\n"

    "## Exercises\n",
    "1. **Load** the digits dataset and **print** the shape of the data and the target.\n",
    "2. **Display** the first ten images in the training set along with their **corresponding target** values.\n",
    "3. **Split** the dataset into a training and test set and **train** a logistic regression classifier (using multinomial extension) on the dataset. **Evaluate** its accuracy.\n",
    "4. Write code that **draws one random image** from the test set, **displays** this image, and **prints the predicted value** of the digit.\n",
    "5. **Train alternative classifiers** and compare their accuracy to the logistic regression classifier. Suggested models:\n",
    "    - Decision Tree\n",
    "    - K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes\n",
    "    - Support Vector Machine (not covered in detail in this course)\n",
    "6. **Tune hyperparameters** (e.g., `max_depth` for Decision Tree, `n_neighbors` for KNN, etc.) to see if you can **improve** the accuracy of the classifiers.\n",
    "7. (Optional) If you'd like to try a **larger dataset**, explore the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits.\n"
