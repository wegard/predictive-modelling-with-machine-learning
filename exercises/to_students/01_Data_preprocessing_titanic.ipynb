    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, weâ€™ll work with the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`). Your goal is to apply essential data preprocessing techniques and gain insights into the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and Inspect the Dataset:**\n",
    "   - Load the `train.csv` file into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "   - Use methods like `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()` to get an initial understanding of the data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Handle Missing Values:**\n",
    "   - Identify which columns contain missing values.\n",
    "   - Decide on and apply an appropriate imputation strategy (e.g., fill missing ages with the median or mean, drop rows if necessary, etc.).\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Address Outliers:**\n",
    "   - Investigate the distribution of continuous variables, focusing on the `Fare` column.\n",
    "   - Determine if any outliers should be capped, removed, or handled in another appropriate way.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Encode Categorical Variables:**\n",
    "   - Convert categorical features such as `Sex` and `Embarked` into numeric form using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Analyze Survival Probabilities:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the probability of survival for passengers in different passenger classes (1st, 2nd, and 3rd).\n",
    "   - Compute the survival probability for male vs. female passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Role of 'pclass' in Survival:**\n",
    "   - What does the `pclass` variable represent?\n",
    "   - Discuss how and why passenger class might influence survival rates.\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. **Importance of Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - Explain why handling missing values and outliers is crucial before fitting a machine learning model.\n",
    "   - Consider how preprocessing steps can impact both the performance and interpretability of your predictive models.\n"
