    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and inspect the dataset (use the train.csv file).\n",
    "2. Check for missing values and impute any missing data as appropriate.\n",
    "3. Check for outliers and handle them in a suitable way (e.g., look at the fare column).\n",
    "4. Encode categorical variables as numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the significance of the 'pclass' variable in the dataset, and how might it affect survival rates?\n",
    "6. Explain why handling missing values and outliers is important in the context of data preprocessing for machine learning."
