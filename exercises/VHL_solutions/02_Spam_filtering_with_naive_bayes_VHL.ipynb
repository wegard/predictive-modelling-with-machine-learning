    "## The naive Bayes classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that is used for classification tasks. It is based on the idea that features in a dataset are independent of each other, which is called the \"naive\" assumption. Despite this assumption not always being true, the naive Bayes classifier has shown to be quite effective in many real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by training on a labeled dataset, where the input data is split into classes based on the target variable. For each class, the algorithm calculates the probability of each feature being associated with that class. During the prediction phase, the algorithm uses these probabilities to predict the class for a new, unlabeled example by finding the class with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the strengths of the naive Bayes classifier is that it is simple and easy to implement, yet it can perform well on a variety of tasks. It is also relatively fast to train, which makes it a good choice for large datasets. However, it is important to note that the assumption of feature independence can sometimes lead to inaccurate predictions, particularly when the features are highly correlated. Despite this, the naive Bayes classifier can still be a useful tool in many situations."

    "\n",
    "To make a prediction for a new, unlabeled example with feature values $x$, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability $P(C_i|x)$ for each class $C_i$:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A classic example of a classification problem that can be solved using the Naive Bayes algorithm is spam filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the input data consists of the text from either emails, sms or other types of messages. The goal is to classify the message as either \"spam\" or \"not spam\" based on the words that appear in the message and other features such as the sender and the subject line. We will only look at the content of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem using the Naive Bayes algorithm, we start by extracting features from the messages, such as the presence or absence of certain words or phrases. We would then create a dataset with these features and the corresponding labels (\"spam\" or \"not spam\") for each message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we train a naive Bayes classifier on this dataset, using the features to make predictions about the labels. The classifier would use the relative frequency of each word or phrase in the \"spam\" and \"not spam\" messages to estimate the probability that a new message is spam or not spam. We could then use this trained classifier to predict the class label for new, unseen email messages.\n",

The messages have been collected from various sources, mostly from a publicly available corpus of SMS messages.\n",

    "1. Load the `smsspamcolection` dataset and inspect its content (ham means \"no spam\"). The dataset is also available on itslearning. Change the label (spam or ham) to a numeric value, e.g., `[0,1]`.\n",
    "2. Split the data into a training and a test set (you can use `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`)\n",
    "3. Create a feature matrix (one feature is one word), in this case this the count matrix. You can use `from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer` to generate this matrix\n",
    "4. Compute the class probabilities $P(C_1) = P(C_i='\\text{Spam}')$ and $P(C_2) = P(C_i='\\text{No spam}')$. What is the probability of an SMS being spam?\n",
    "5. Compute the conditional probabilities $P(x_i|C_1)$ and $P(x_i|C_2)$.\n",
    "6. Print out the five most used word in the messages classified as spam and not-spam.\n",
    "7. Calculate $log(P(C_1|x)) \\propto log(P(C_1)) + \\sum_{i=1}^n log(P(x_i|C_1))$ and $log(P(C_2|x)) \\propto log(P(C_2)) + \\sum_{i=1}^n log(P(x_i|C_2))$\n",
    "8. Without using Scikit-learn write a classifier and classify the messages in the test set using the prediction rule and evaluate how well your predictions are compared to the true labels.\n",
    "9. Use a builtin model for Naive Bayes in  Scikit-learn, e.g., `MultinomialNB` to train the classifier on the training set and evaluate how well it performs on the test set."
