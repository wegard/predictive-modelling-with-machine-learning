    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept that refers to the tradeoff between two sources of model error, that is: **bias** and **variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simpler model.\n",
    "Models with high bias tend to make strong assumptions about the underlying data and therefore have limited capacity to capture complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "As a result, models with high bias tend to underfit the data, meaning that they perform poorly on both the training data and new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance refers to the error that is introduced by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data.\n",
    "Models with high variance tend to be very flexible and capture many details of the training data, but they may overfit the data, meaning that they perform well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of machine learning is to find a balance between bias and variance to produce a model that generalizes well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model has high bias, increasing its complexity will reduce the bias but increase the variance.\n",
