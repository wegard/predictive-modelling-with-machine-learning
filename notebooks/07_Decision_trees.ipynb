However, trees can grow very deep and overfit unless carefully controlled (e.g., pruning, limiting depth).\n"

    "## 1. Decision Tree Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is built by **recursively partitioning** the data into subsets based on certain splitting criteria. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Root Node**: Contains the entire training set.\n",
    "2. **Split**: Evaluate each feature and possible thresholds to find a split that best separates the classes.\n",
    "3. **Child Nodes**: Data is partitioned into subsets based on the selected split.\n",
    "4. **Repeat** until stopping criteria are met (e.g., max depth, min samples per leaf, or no further improvement).\n",
    "\n",
    "In **classification** problems, leaf nodes represent class labels (the majority or predicted probability). In **regression**, leaf nodes contain a predicted numeric value (often the mean of that node's samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key advantage**: The resulting model is relatively easy to **interpret** (by following the path of splits from root to leaf). The splits can sometimes mimic human decision processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key disadvantage**: Decision Trees can **overfit** easily if allowed to grow too large or too specific, capturing noise instead of true patterns."
