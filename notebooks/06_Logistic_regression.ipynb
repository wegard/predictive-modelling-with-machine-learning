    "## Logistic Regression Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression** is commonly used for binary classification (e.g., 0 or 1, \"yes\" or \"no\"). Despite its name, it is actually a **classification** technique rather than a regression technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Form**:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\hat{y} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\\quad \\text{where}\\quad z = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\ldots + \\beta_p x_p.\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - $\\hat{y}$ represents the **predicted probability** of the positive class (labelled as 1).\n",
    "    - $z$ is the linear combination of input features and parameters (weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpreting $\\beta_j$**:\n",
    "    - Each coefficient $\\beta_j$ corresponds to the change in the **log-odds** of the outcome per unit change in the associated feature $x_j$.\n",
    "    - \"Log-odds\" means $\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)$, where $p$ is the probability of the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Likelihood Maximization**:\n",
    "    - Logistic Regression is typically fit by **maximizing** the **likelihood** (or equivalently, **minimizing** the **negative log-likelihood**).\n",
    "    - Common optimization methods include **Gradient Descent**, **Newton-CG**, **L-BFGS**, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decision Threshold**:\n",
    "    - By default, $\\hat{y} > 0.5$ is classified as 1, else 0.\n",
    "    - This threshold can be adjusted based on problem context (e.g., wanting fewer false positives vs. fewer false negatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multi-class Extensions**:\n",
    "    - **One-vs-All (OvA)**: Train a separate binary classifier per class.\n",
    "    - **Multinomial (Softmax) Regression**: Model all classes simultaneously with a softmax output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will explore an example using the Titanic dataset, aiming to predict passenger survival (1) or death (0)."
