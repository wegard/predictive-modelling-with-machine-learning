    "Ensemble methods are a type of machine learning technique that combine the predictions of multiple models to make more accurate predictions than any individual model could. These methods are particularly useful in situations where the individual models have high variance or make strong, complex predictions. There are several types of ensemble methods, including boosting, bagging, and bootstrapped ensembles.\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular type of ensemble method is boosting, in which a series of weak models are trained sequentially, with each model attempting to correct the mistakes of the previous model. The final prediction is made by combining the predictions of all the models in the ensemble. Boosting algorithms include AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of ensemble method is bagging, in which a group of models are trained independently on different random subsets of the training data. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all the models in the ensemble. Bagging algorithms include Random Forests and Extra Trees. Ensemble methods have been successful in a wide range of applications, including image classification and speech recognition."
