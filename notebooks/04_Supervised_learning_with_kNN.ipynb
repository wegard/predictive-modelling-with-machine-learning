    "## Definition of supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which a model is trained on labeled data. This means that the data used to train the model includes both input data and corresponding correct output labels. The goal of supervised learning is to use the labeled training data to learn the relationship between the input and output data, and then make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training phase, the model is presented with the input data and the corresponding correct output labels. The model makes predictions based on the input data, and then compares its predictions to the correct labels to determine how accurate they are. The model is then adjusted, or \"trained\", based on the error between its predictions and the correct labels. This process is repeated multiple times, using different portions of the training data or different combinations of training and validation data, until the model reaches a satisfactory level of accuracy. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data."

    "\n",
    "The k-nearest neighbors ($k$-NN) algorithm is a simple and widely used machine learning technique for classification. The basic idea is to find the $k$ training examples that are closest (i.e., most similar) to a given test point, and then assign the label or value of the majority of those $k$ examples to the test point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to measure the similarity between two points is to use the Euclidean distance, which is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared differences of their coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d(x,y) = \\sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + ... + (x_n - y_n)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ and $y$ are two points in $n$-dimensional space, and $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the $i$-th coordinates of $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a $k$-NN classification problem, given a test point $x$ and a set of training points with labels, the $k$-NN algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each training point, calculate the distance between it and $x$.\n",
    "2. Sort the training points by increasing distance to $x$.\n",
    "3. Select the $k$ training points that are closest to $x$.\n",
    "4. Assign the label of the majority of the $k$ selected points to $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple algorithm can be very effective for some types of problems, especially if the decision boundary between classes is relatively smooth and regular. However, it can be sensitive to the choice of $k$ and the presence of noisy or irrelevant features in the data.\n",
