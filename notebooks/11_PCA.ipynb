    "# Introduction to Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that is commonly used in machine learning and statistics.\n",
    "The goal of PCA is to find the most important underlying structure in a dataset, which is often a lower-dimensional subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to mathematically describe PCA is through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Center the data by subtracting the mean from each feature\n",
    "2. Compute the covariance matrix of the centered data\n",
    "3. Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix\n",
    "4. Select the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues, these are the principal components\n",
    "5. Project the data onto the subspace spanned by the principal components\n",
    "\n",
    "The centered data is represented as $\\bar{X}$, the covariance matrix is represented as $\\Sigma$, the eigenvectors are represented as $V$ and the eigenvalues are represented as $\\Lambda$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{X} = X - mean(X)$$\n",
    "$$\\Sigma = (1/n) \\bar{X}'\\bar{X}$$\n",
    "$$ \\Lambda, V = eig(\\Sigma)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ is the original data matrix, $mean(X)$ is the mean of all columns of $X$, $n$ is the number of observations in $X$. \n",
    "The $eig()$ function is used to calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "These principal components can be used to project the data onto a lower dimensional subspace, resulting in a new matrix called $\\hat{X}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{X} = \\bar{X} V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This new matrix $\\hat{X}$ will have the same number of rows as the original data but fewer columns and will contain the most important information of the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative: Estimation using SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is another technique that can be used to estimate the principal components of a dataset. \n",
    "SVD is a factorization of the matrix, and it can be used to decompose a matrix into simpler, more interpretable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVD decomposition of a matrix X can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = U \\Sigma V'$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $U$ and $V$ are orthonormal matrices and $\\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, called the singular values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the principal components using SVD, we can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the SVD of the data matrix $X$: $X = U \\Sigma V'$\n",
    "2. The columns of $V$ are the right singular vectors, and they correspond to the principal components of the data\n",
    "3. The diagonal elements of the matrix $\\Sigma$ are the singular values, and they represent the amount of variance explained by each principal component\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like PCA, we can use the principal components obtained from SVD to project the data onto a lower dimensional subspace, resulting in a new matrix called $\\hat{X}$: $\\hat{X} = XV$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example of how to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset."

    "## Feature scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling through standardization (or Z-score normalization) can be an important preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "As we have talked about earlier, standardization involves rescaling the features such that they have the properties of a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PCA we are interested in the components that maximize the variance.\n",
    "If one component (e.g. human height) varies less than another (e.g. weight) because of their respective scales (meters vs. kilos), PCA might determine that the direction of maximal variance more closely corresponds with the weight axis, if those features are not scaled.\n",
    "As a change in height of one meter can be considered much more important than the change in weight of one kilogram, this is not what we want.\n",
